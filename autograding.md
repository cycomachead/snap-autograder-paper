## Abstract:
In this paper, we present the design and use of an in-browser autograder for a visual programming language, Snap<i>!</i> [REF].
Snap<i>!</i>, Build Your Own Block is a web-based, blocks-based language inspired by Scratch [REF], for the course _The Beauty and Joy of Computing_[REF], at UC Berkeley. Before planning to build a MOOC of BJC we needed a way of evaluating student work that didn't involve human grading.
